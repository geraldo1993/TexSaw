Just browsing through the source (or trying it on the server) we see that the function get_terrifying_secret
	is never called - the menu has an option for us but it is disabled

When we look at the structure of a room - we see that the 'review' is a 256 character buffer
In memory (as in the source) this will be right next to the function pointer for getting the review

The source shows that when we leave a review, we copy a 1024 byte buffer into the review, which is only
	256 bytes long. We can thereby write past the review buffer and over the function pointers.
Thereby we can write a new function pointer over the get_review function and have it call get_terrifying_secret instead

To do this we need the memory address of get_terrifying_secret
	We can do this by running 'gdb overlook'
	This loads the overlook program into the gdb debugger
	In gdb we can type 'print get_terrifying_secret' to get its address
	Doing this on 'get_review' as well shows they only vary in the last byte

With this information - and knowing that the addresses are stored in Least Significant Byte order
	we can craft our exploit. If we send 256 bytes followed by the hex byte '\x2c' from get_terrfying_secret
	we overwrite the get_review function pointer. Then when we call get_review from the menu
	it will call get_terrifying_secret. Doing this on room 237 gets us the key.
