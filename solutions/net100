In this challenge we are given a pcap, so the first step is to open it in wireshark for analysis.
A standard tool in wireshark is exporting http objects (File>export>Objects>HTTP).
This lets us view all the objects passed between the server and client.
One of these objects is an image from the site imgur.
When we save this object and view it locallym we see that the image shows the key.
