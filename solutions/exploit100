In this problem we have a 50 byte buffer - answer - just before an integer that we're trying to change
We receive a 200 byte string from the user and use the insecure function, strcpy, to put it onto answer
This lets us overflow onto the integer to solve the problem

If we send 64 'A's we see the integer is now 0x41414141 - 4 'A's in hex
If we send 54 'A's (experiment a bit to find the right length) and follow it with the
	'password' - 0xCAB4DEAD - we get an integer of 0xADDEB4CA
Integers are stored in Least Significant Byte order, so we need to actually reverse the
	bytes - 0xADDEB4AD - to pass the check

Sending an input of 54 'A's plus the hex - 0xADDEB4CA - then returns the key
