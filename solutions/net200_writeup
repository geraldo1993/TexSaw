net200 is simple a pcap a.k.a packet capture. To verify this is
actually a pcap you can run the "file" command against the file.
This will provide back more information about the file incase
you are not sure about its true beings.

root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# file net200_fun.pcap 
net200_fun.pcap: tcpdump capture file (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Ethernet, capture length 65535)

After noticing that it is a tcpdump capture file we can conclude
this is really a packet capture of network traffic. So to do further
analysis on the file we open it up in wireshark. 

root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# wireshark net200_fun.pcap

Looking at the pcap off the bat you should notice, printer
ssdp, arp. https, http and some other traffic. Typically
plaintext files can be pulled from this caputures multiple
ways. One way to see if there is any files being transported
across the network is to view export objects. That can be
accomplished by doing the following.

File > Export Objects > http

You will see 3 different tcp segments happen all of them have the
same meaning. One is base64 the other hex and the last ascii.
PdF-FuN.pdf is the object of interests here. Clicking on that segment
will should to the trace of that connection. But our goal here is 
to grab the PdF-FuN.pdf from the pcap. Clicking the save as button on
the bottom right corner of the wireshark window, you can save the object
as is to your local machine. 

root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# file PdF-FuN.pdf 
PdF-FuN.pdf: PDF document, version 1.1
root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# 

Opening up the PDF (which you should do with caution. Probably in a sandbox)
you will notice it has a note. Use your choice of PDF reader.

"Oh Haiya. Glad you made it here the key is close
Click inside the rectangle to save csg to a temporary folder and launch it.
Click here"

This part was a little joke but still real. I made a button that could drop
the file but did it for the laughs. Your next would be to carve
out the file inside of the pdf. There are a few ways you could
do this. File carving is the way I go for forensics and other
situations. Although i do hear MS word might be able to do it.

csg is the name of the embeddedfile within the PDF.

Once extracting the csg.bin you can run it and get the key

root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# ../net200/csg 
Hey there I see you got this far. Well here is the key my friend!!!
