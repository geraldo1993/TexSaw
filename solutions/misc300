This problem is based on the following article:
	http://www.devttys0.com/2013/10/reverse-engineering-a-d-link-backdoor/

Following that paper gives almost a step-by-step guide to finding the exploit
Basically, students would have to find the tool binwalk (googling Firmware Analysis Tool brings it up near the top)
Then they'll have a SquashFS and need to find the vulnerability (google Router Vulnerability, brings up an article on this
	specific exploit near the top)

This problem was intended to be difficult so that any attendees with CTF experience would still be challenged.
