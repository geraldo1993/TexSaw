Once again, this problem is not vulnerable to SQL injection and we login with the provided credentials.
If we look at the cookies, like in web200, we still see the cookie "user=demo"
If we change this cookie to "user=admin" we still can't see the key, because it's doing a simple checksum
Luckily, the checksum algorithm is provided for us and we see that it's just adding together the bytes.
It's rotating every for bytes (so byte 0, 4, 8 are added: 1, 5, 9 are added etc.), taking %10 of the result
	(145 %10 = 5, 872 %10 = 2, etc.) and then just concatenating the result.
It's doing this over every cookie, not just the user cookie so we can add in a new cookie "c=0000"
With 4 zeroes, we know that each location of the checksum will be modified by one of the zeroes.
We send this to get an intermediate checksum.
Then we send "c=1000" and check this against the previous checksum, this shows us the offset
	i.e. if the first zero lines up with the second byte or third byte
We can then add to each 0 to meet the value it's checking against, which lets us pass the check
	now that we're logged in as admin, we can again view the flag under API Key
