As the readme suggests: "Fix me then find me"

This packet capture you only get one signle tcp segment
that is none connecting. But you dont know that until you
repair the pcap itself.

kali:~/texsaw/challenges# file net300_findme.pcap 
net300_findme.pcap: data

As you can see if you try to open that file up in wireshark
you will get an error stating this file is not reconigzed.
As you learned from the previous net200 challenge magic number
is everything when it comes to file identification. 
Looking around the internet you can find what the magic
number for a pcap should be d4 c3 b2 a1
You need to replace the first 4 bytes of the net300 pcap with
the correct one.
root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# hexdump -C net300_findme.pcap |more
00000000  4c 55 4c 5a 02 00 04 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |LULZ............|

^----- bad

Using your favorite editor i prefer bless change the LULZ 4 bytes to the correct d4c3b2a1

root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# hexdump -C net300.pcap | head
00000000  d4 c3 b2 a1 02 00 04 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|

Saving the output to a new file name (net300.pca) incase i mess it up.

root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# file net300.pcap 
net300.pcap: tcpdump capture file (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Ethernet, capture length 32767)


Now you can open up the packet capture in your network sniffer of choice :)
Once you have opened the pcap you will see one segment with not much information.
If you open it in wireshark one thing that should tip you off is the time column
is incorrect. It shows all zeros. Keeping that in mine you might want to try out
tcpdump. 

root@kali:~/texsaw/challenges# tcpdump -ttvvr net300.pcap 
reading from file net300.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
32985966.967503 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto TCP (6), length 40)
    1.3.3.7.31337 > li371-224.members.linode.com.12345: Flags [S], cksum 0x05d8 (correct), seq 0, win 8192, length 0

As you can see now you have a time frame but its not the linux epoch time we are looking for.
It seems to look like gps coordinates. The decimal seems to represent a break in the gps
32985966.967503 = 32985966 -967503

Putting that GPS coordinates in you will get a location and the name of the building is the key
